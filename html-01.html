 <p>The Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower is a skyscraper in Brooklyn, New York City. Designed by Halsey, McCormack & Helmer, it was constructed from 1927 to 1929 as the new headquarters for the Williamsburgh Savings Bank. At 41 stories and 512 feet (156 m) tall, the Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower was the tallest building in Brooklyn until 2009. The bank occupied the lowest floors, while the remaining stories were rented as offices. By the late 20th century, dentists' offices occupied much of the structure. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the tower's exterior as a city landmark in 1977 and designated some of the interior spaces in 1996. The building's upper stories were converted to luxury condominium apartments from 2005 to 2007, while the banking hall became an event space. Over the years, local residents have used the building both as a clock and as a landmark for directions, and the tower has been used as a filming location. (Full article...)</p>

    The banded demoiselle (Calopteryx splendens) is a species of damselfly in the family Calopterygidae. It is a Eurasian species, occurring from the Atlantic coast eastwards to Lake Baikal and northwestern China. Often found along slow-flowing streams and rivers, it is a common species throughout much of its range. This male banded demoiselle was photographed at Farmoor in Oxfordshire, England, near the River Thames. Males have a dark wing patch that starts at the nodus but can reach up to the wing tip in southern races.
